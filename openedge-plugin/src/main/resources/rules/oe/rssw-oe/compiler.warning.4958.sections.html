<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>This rule raises an issue whenever an <code>IMPORT UNFORMATTED</code> statement references more than one field.</p>
<p>The <code>UNFORMATTED</code> phrase of the <code>IMPORT</code> statement implies that all data on the input line should be read into the first field in the <code>IMPORT</code> statement without regard to delimiters in the data.
Your code has multiple fields listed in the <code>IMPORT</code> statement; subsequent fields will not be used in the <code>IMPORT</code> statement at runtime.</p> 

<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<h3>Noncompliant Code Example</h3>
<pre>
DEFINE VARIABLE x1 AS CHARACTER   NO-UNDO.
DEFINE VARIABLE x2 AS CHARACTER   NO-UNDO.

IMPORT UNFORMATTED x1 x2. // x2 will always be empty
</pre>

<h3>Compliant Solution</h3>
<pre>
DEFINE VARIABLE x1 AS CHARACTER   NO-UNDO.
DEFINE VARIABLE x2 AS CHARACTER   NO-UNDO.

IMPORT UNFORMATTED x1.
</pre>
