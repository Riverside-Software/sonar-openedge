<p>A preprocessor expression, such as would appear in an &amp;IF or &amp;ELSEIF, contained an element that was not a constant. Progress preprocessor expressions must consist solely of constants or of preprocessor names that expand to constants.
For example: &amp;IF A &lt; 3 &amp;THEN ... is incorrect, because A is not a constant or a preprocessor reference that expands to a constant.</p>
<p>As the compiler will (almost) silently discard the entire code block in the &amp;THEN or &amp;ELSE block, this issue should absolutely be fixed</p>

<p><b>Please note that an issue in the OpenEdge compiler prevents this warning to be reported at the right line number. This is the case up to 11.7</b></p>

<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
&amp;SCOPED-DEFINE VAR1 xxx
&amp;SCOPED-DEFINE VAR2 yyy
&amp;IF {&amp;VAR1} EQ {&amp;VAR2} &amp;THEN
  // xxx and yyy are constants and can't be evaluated
&amp;ENDIF
</pre>

<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
&amp;SCOPED-DEFINE VAR1 xxx
&amp;SCOPED-DEFINE VAR2 yyy
&amp;IF "{&amp;VAR1}" EQ "{&amp;VAR2}" &amp;THEN
  // Comparison on string values
&amp;ENDIF
</pre>
