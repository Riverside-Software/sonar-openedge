A dataslot represents a specific piece of data used in a business\n        process. Dataslots (Progress.BPM.DataSlotobjects) are defined at theProgress.BPM.Processlevel and each workstep in a process may use some,\n        all, or none of the dataslots for input, input-output, and output. A workstep can have one\n        or more input or output dataslots attached; or it can have none.The main purpose of a dataslot is to store data values. A dataslot object has additional\n        properties that provide metadata about the dataslot, such as its name, data type, and access\n        modifier (read-only, for example). A dataslot can also have an optional list of valid\n        values; see theChoices propertyfor more\n        information.You can pass data between worksteps by attaching the same dataslot to multiple\n        worksteps—for example, you can attach a dataslot as an output from one workstep and an input\n        to the next.When ABL code sets theValueproperty of aDataSlotobject, that value remains local to the ABLDataSlotobject— it does not\n        immediately affect the value of the corresponding dataslot object on the Business Process\n        Server, nor does it affect the value of any otherDataSlotinstance in the\n        ABL program that may represent the same server dataslot.You can retrieve and set the dataslots associated with a task through theGetDataSlots( )method on aTaskobject. Dataslots\n        retrieved this way will be updated on the server when you callComplete( )on theTask. You can also retrieve and update dataslots associated with the\n        entire process through theProgress.BPM.Processclass (using theGetDataSlots( )method and theUpdateDataSlots( )method, respectively).Note:The fact that ABL dataslot objects are updatedonly whenComplete( )is called on aTaskobject has implications\n        for use of theReassign( )andMakeAvailable( )methods on\n        that same object. If you callReassign( )orMakeAvailable( ), any changes you may have made to dataslots associated\n        with theTaskwill never get sent to the server, since that action occurs\n        only when you callComplete( )on theTask.
