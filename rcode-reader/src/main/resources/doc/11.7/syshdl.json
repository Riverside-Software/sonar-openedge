When a procedure file invokes an internal procedure or a user-defined function, ABL searches for it, among other places, in the super procedures (if any) of the procedure file and of the current ABL session. The procedure-search option determines which procedures are searched. For more information on the rules that ABL uses to search for internal procedures and user-defined functions, seeSearch rules. For a sample program that uses the ADD-SUPER-PROCEDURE method, see the reference entry for theRUN SUPER statement. Returns FALSE for a Web service procedure.

SEARCH-TARGET starts searching the super procedures of the procedure file that originally invoked the current internal procedure or user-defined function (the procedure with the original RUN statement).

A given super-proc-hdl can be added as either SEARCH-TARGET or SEARCH-SELF, but cannot be added as both.

For theBuffer object handle, this attribute causes the row to be backed out rather than merged with theMERGE-CHANGES( ) methodor theMERGE-ROW-CHANGES( ) method. This attribute is marshalled between the client and the AppServer. For the ERROR-STATUS system handle, the ERROR attribute indicates whether the ABL ERROR condition was raised in the most recent statement that used the NO-ERROR option. If no ERROR condition was raised in that statement, the value of the ERROR attribute is FALSE. The ERROR attribute is writeable for a ProDataSet object, a Temp-table object, and a Buffer object. You can set the ERROR attribute programmatically in order to manage the application response to errors. For example, you might set the ERROR attribute to FALSE in order to ignore all errors that might be returned for a statement using the NO-ERROR option. However, note that manually setting this attribute has no affect on ABL error management. Thus, if you set the ERROR attribute to TRUE, the AVM doesnotalso raise the ERROR condition."

The FILE-NAME attribute of the FILE-INFO or RCODE-INFO handle is the name of the file used by subsequent references to the handle. You can specify the filename with a.p,.r, or no extension.

As the AVM filters these events more often, it executes procedures less efficiently, but allows other windows applications more opportunity to execute. Adjusting the internal event filter is particularly useful during background processing, such as report generation. The default value, zero, tells the AVM never to filter events internally, giving ABL applications maximum access to execution resources. This is perfectly adequate for interactive ABL applications that block for input often, giving other applications enough opportunity to execute. For values greater than zero, the lower the value, the more often the AVM internally filters events, giving other applications greater opportunity to execute, but slowing down the AVM execution. However, similar to a TRUE value for the IMMEDIATE-DISPLAY attribute, low non-zero values also cause the AVM to refresh the display more often, potentially providing crisper display interaction. Low non-zero values also provide better interoperability with other applications, for example, using Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE). The maximum value you can set is 9999. In general, set this attribute greater than zero only for code segments that perform lengthy background operations, and reset it to zero before the application blocks for interactive input (for example, executes a WAIT-FOR or UPDATE statement).

Data type:LOGICAL Applies to:Asynchronous request object handle,Buffer object handle,COMPILER system handle,ERROR-STATUS system handle,ProDataSet object handle,Temp-table object handle The ERROR attribute corresponds to theERROR function. For the asynchronous request object handle, the ERROR attribute indicates that the ERROR condition was encountered during the processing of an AppServer or Web Server request. If the COMPLETE attribute is FALSE, the value of this attribute is the Unknown value (?). This attribute is set immediately before the event procedure is executed. For the COMPILER system handle, the ERROR attribute indicates whether an error occurred in the preceding compilation. If no error occurred in the preceding compilation, the value of ERROR is the Unknown value (?). For theProDataSet object handle,Temp-table object handle, andBuffer object handle, the ERROR attribute indicates whether an error occurred during a FILL or SAVE-ROW-CHANGES operation. For a ProDataSet object handle or a temp-table object handle, the ERROR attribute is reset to FALSE when one of the following methods removes the object's before-image records: The ERROR attribute is effective only if a before-table is NO-UNDO during a data source update. If the before-table is UNDO, the ERROR attribute is lost. For theBuffer object handle, this attribute causes the row to be backed out rather than merged with theMERGE-CHANGES( ) methodor theMERGE-ROW-CHANGES( ) method. This attribute is marshalled between the client and the AppServer. For the ERROR-STATUS system handle, the ERROR attribute indicates whether the ABL ERROR condition was raised in the most recent statement that used the NO-ERROR option. If no ERROR condition was raised in that statement, the value of the ERROR attribute is FALSE. The ERROR attribute is writeable for a ProDataSet object, a Temp-table object, and a Buffer object. You can set the ERROR attribute programmatically in order to manage the application response to errors. For example, you might set the ERROR attribute to FALSE in order to ignore all errors that might be returned for a statement using the NO-ERROR option. However, note that manually setting this attribute has no affect on ABL error management. Thus, if you set the ERROR attribute to TRUE, the AVM doesnotalso raise the ERROR condition."
