Therefore, if PROFILER:LISTINGS attribute is FALSE the first time a procedure is executed, then setting it to TRUE at a later time does not cause the profiler to generate the listing file for that procedure. In other words, the profiler only registers a module, using a unique identifier, the first time the module executes. The profiler only generates debug listing files for modules that are external procedures. If PROFILER:LISTINGS is FALSE when a procedure first executes, then the profiler never tries to generate a debug listing file for that procedure. It fails if the source files are not accessible. The source files that make up a procedure must be in the PROPATH in order for the profiler to generate a debug listing file. If the profiler cannot generate a debug listing file for a given procedure, then the profiler treats the procedure as though the PROFILER:LISTINGS setting was FALSE when that procedure first executes.

Because the attribute contains an encryption key, any attempt to read the attribute is a compiler error. Both the XCODE utility and this attribute have an eight-character limit for keys. However, neither the utility or the attribute issues a warning or error if the key is longer. Instead, the utility and attribute use the first eight characters and ignore additional characters. The XCODE utility does not perform code page conversions and does not use the -cpinternal parameter when encrypting files. Therefore, the source code and key will use the default code page of the operating system where you run the XCODE utility. If a different code page is in effect where XCODE-SESSION-KEY is set, then code page conversions may prevent the attribute key from matching the XCODE utility key and the compile fails. To prevent this case, use only US-ASCII characters, which are found in all code pages below code point 128. You cannot use XCODE with the XREF, XREF-XML, STRING-XREF, or LISTING options together.

The value of the MULTITASKING-INTERVAL attribute determines how often the AVM internally filters events (messages) between itself and other Windows applications. As the AVM filters these events more often, it executes procedures less efficiently, but allows other windows applications more opportunity to execute. Adjusting the internal event filter is particularly useful during background processing, such as report generation. The default value, zero, tells the AVM never to filter events internally, giving ABL applications maximum access to execution resources. This is perfectly adequate for interactive ABL applications that block for input often, giving other applications enough opportunity to execute. For values greater than zero, the lower the value, the more often the AVM internally filters events, giving other applications greater opportunity to execute, but slowing down the AVM execution. However, similar to a TRUE value for the IMMEDIATE-DISPLAY attribute, low non-zero values also cause the AVM to refresh the display more often, potentially providing crisper display interaction. Low non-zero values also provide better interoperability with other applications, for example, using Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE). The maximum value you can set is 9999. In general, set this attribute greater than zero only for code segments that perform lengthy background operations, and reset it to zero before the application blocks for interactive input (for example, executes a WAIT-FOR or UPDATE statement).
