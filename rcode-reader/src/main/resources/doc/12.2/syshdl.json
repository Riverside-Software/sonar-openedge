Therefore, if PROFILER:LISTINGS attribute is FALSE the first time a procedure is executed, then setting it to TRUE at a later time does not cause the profiler to generate the listing file for that procedure. In other words, the profiler only registers a module, using a unique identifier, the first time the module executes. The profiler only generates debug listing files for modules that are external procedures. If PROFILER:LISTINGS is FALSE when a procedure first executes, then the profiler never tries to generate a debug listing file for that procedure. It fails if the source files are not accessible. The source files that make up a procedure must be in the PROPATH in order for the profiler to generate a debug listing file.

The expression patterns are interpreted in the same way as does the ABL built-in MATCHES() function. If a procedure name matches one of the patterns on the list, then the profiler records detailed timing information for every executable line in that procedure. The pattern matching is not case sensitive. In addition to recording summary timing data for each executable line, TRACE-FILTER records timing information each time a statement is executed. With this detailed information, a complete execution trace for the application can be established. If the value of TRACE-FILTER is \" \", then the pattern does not match any procedure names. When no procedure names are matched, the only tracing information the profiler records is what is specified by thePROFILER:TRACINGattribute. If the value is \"*\", then the pattern matches all procedure names. Examples:To get tracing information for all enable_UI procedures, set TRACE-FILTER to \"enable_UI *\". To get tracing information for all enable_UI procedures and also all executable lines in the procedure hello.p, set TRACE-FILTER to \"enable_UI*,*hello.p\". The TRACE-FILTER patterns are examined by the profiler only as it analyzes the data in the raw data temporary file, in preparation for writing data to the output file. This usually occurs during PROFILER:WRITE-DATA() calls or at the end of the session. In theory, the TRACE-FILTER value can be set any time before the profiler writes the data for the session to its output file. However, when the raw data temporary file becomes too large, the profiler does a partial analysis on the fly. To avoid this, set the TRACE-FILTER pattern before any procedure intended to match the pattern is run. Redundant entries in the PROFILER:TRACE-FILTER list are automatically removed."

The FILE-NAME attribute of the COMPILER handle is the name of the source file from the preceding compilation. If no error occurred during the preceding compilation, FILE-NAME assumes the unknown value (?). For the PROFILER handle, FILE-NAME is the file into which the profiling data is written after the raw recorded data is analyzed. The file name must be set before data can be stored. The default value is the unknown value (?). The FILE-NAME attribute of the FILE-INFO or RCODE-INFO handle is the name of the file used by subsequent references to the handle. You can specify the filename with a.p,.r, or no extension. If you set FILE-NAME to a relative pathname, then the AVM searches thePROPATHto find the file. Otherwise, the AVM looks for the file specified by the absolute pathname. When used with FILE-INFO, the filename can contain Unicode characters. When used with RCODE-INFO, the filename cannot contain characters outside of the non-Unicode code page. For more information about Unicode and code pages, seeInternationalize ABL Applications. The FILE-NAME attribute of a procedure handle is the pathname of the procedure file that contains the procedure associated with the handle. If the procedure file is specified by the Startup Procedure (-p) parameter, then the attribute contains the full pathname of the file. Otherwise, it contains the pathname exactly as specified in the RUN statement that invoked it. The procedure can be local or remote. The FILE-NAME attribute of the COMPILER handle and procedure handle is read only."

As the AVM filters these events more\noften, it executes procedures less efficiently, but allows other\nwindows applications more opportunity to execute.

The default value, zero, tells\nthe AVM never to filter events internally, giving ABL applications\nmaximum access to execution resources. This is perfectly adequate\nfor interactive ABL applications that block for input often, giving\nother applications enough opportunity to execute.

However, similar to a TRUE value\nfor the IMMEDIATE-DISPLAY attribute, low non-zero values also cause the\nAVM to refresh the display more often, potentially providing crisper\ndisplay interaction.

Data\ntype:CHARACTER Applies\nto:SESSION system handle This\nattribute is valid only if the REMOTE attribute is TRUE. When a client application requests a connection with an application server,\n        the application server creates an area to store this value for the connection. The initial\n        value is the Unknown value (?). This attribute, while available in session-managed and session-free\n        operating modes, has practical application only on a session-managed application server,\n        where more than one application server session can service the same client connection. This\n        value is available to any Connect procedure, Activate procedure, Deactivate procedure, or\n        Disconnect procedure that you have configured for the application server, as well as any\n        application procedure. Thus, each application server session that services a client\n        connection can pass context information to the next. For an application server session, the AVM sets the\n        SERVER-CONNECTION-CONTEXT attribute to the Unknown value (?) each time a new connection is assigned to the process. If the application\n        server operating mode is session-managed, the application server session procedure can also\n        reset this attribute to an application-specific value. However, any such value does not last\n        beyond the current client connection within the current application server session. Thus,\n        application server sessions running on a session-managed application server cannot pass\n        information among themselves using this attribute. In session-free operating mode, any attempt to set this attribute raises a\n        WARNING condition in the application server session, which writes a message to the\n        application server log file, and the value remains unchanged. You can handle the WARNING\n        condition by including the NO-ERROR option in the statement that attempts to set the value,\n        and checkingERROR-STATUS:NUM-MESSAGESfor a value greater\n        than zero.
