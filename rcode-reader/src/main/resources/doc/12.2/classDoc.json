For example, \"abc\", \"123.45\", \"-13E+20\", \"true\", \"false\", and \"null\". A JsonObject or a JsonArray element is returned in its serialized form. That is, as a LONGCHAR representing all the values it contains. For example, {\"name\":\"Alfred\",\"age\":32} or [\"jump rope\", 17]. The method is useful especially in situations where JSON number values cannot be represented by any of the ABL numeric data types (INTEGER, INT64 and DECIMAL). This method allows you to retrieve values regardless of the JSON data type. GetCharacter( ) and GetLongchar( ) require that the JSON value be a JSON string.",
