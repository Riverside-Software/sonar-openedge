## How do I get started?

While having a build process based on [PCT](https://github.com/Riverside-Software/pct) is recommended (as some metrics and rules can only be executed with the build output of PCT), you can still try the OpenEdge plugin for SonarQube directly on your codebase, just follow the [instructions](https://github.com/Riverside-Software/sonar-openedge/wiki/Getting-started).

PCT is open-source and free, but if you want to rely on our consulting services, please contact us at contact@riverside-software.fr
